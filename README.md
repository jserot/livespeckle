LiveSpeckle
===========

LiveSpeckle is plugin for the [Genika Astro)(https://airylab.com/genika-astro) image acquisition
sofware decicated to the observation of double stars.  LiveSpeckle computes and displays in
real-time the power spectrum and the autocorrelation of a double star image. These signatures are
often used to establish the duplicity of a star when it cannot be infered from the direct (spatial
domain) image due to seeing conditions.
